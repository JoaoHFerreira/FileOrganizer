FileOrganizer is a community-driven project. Contribution is welcome, encouraged, and appreciated.
It is also essential for the development of the project.

## Reporting Issues

### You have a problem

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search-luke) for any open issue already covering
your problem.

If you find one, comment on it so we can know there are more people experiencing it.

Then, you can go ahead and create an issue with as much detail as you can provide.
It should include the data gathered as indicated above, along with:

1. How to reproduce the problem
2. What the correct behavior should be
3. What the actual behavior is

We will do our very best to help you.

### You have a suggestion

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search-luke) for any open issue already covering
your suggestion.

If you find one, comment on it so we can know there are more people supporting it.

## Submitting Pull Requests

### Getting started

You should be familiar with the basics of
[contributing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and have a fork
[properly set up](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Contribution-Technical-Practices).

You MUST always create PRs with _a dedicated branch_ based on the latest upstream tree.

If you create your own PR, please make sure you do it right. Also be so kind as to reference
any issue that would be solved in the PR description body,
[for instance](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
_"Fixes #XXXX"_ for issue number XXXX.

### You have a solution

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search-luke) for any open issue already covering
your [problem](#you-have-a-problem), and any pending/merged/rejected PR covering your solution.

If the solution is already reported, try it out and +1 the pull request if the
solution works ok. On the other hand, if you think your solution is better, post
it with a reference to the other one so we can have both solutions to compare.
